# Seawall Defender: Quick Play Edition

## About the Game

Seawall Defender is an educational browser-based game that teaches players about coastal wave dynamics and seawall protection strategies. Players must defend their seawall against different types of waves by predicting wave behavior and selecting appropriate defense mechanisms.

Developed by Soheil Radfar (Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Alabama)

## Game Objective

Your mission is to protect your seawall from damaging wave impacts over five rounds. You'll need to understand wave dynamics and make strategic decisions to minimize damage to your seawall structure.

## Wave Types

The game features two main types of waves that impact your seawall differently:

- **Breaking Waves** (ðŸ”´): These powerful waves break upon impact with the seawall, creating intense, concentrated forces. They deal heavy damage (10 HP) to your seawall if not properly managed.
  
- **Non-Breaking Waves** (ðŸ”µ): These waves maintain their form when hitting the seawall, creating a more distributed pressure. They deal lighter damage (3 HP) to your structure.

## Game Mechanics

### Game Flow

1. **Wave Approaching**: Each round, a wave approaches your seawall with specific height, period, and water depth characteristics.

2. **Wave Prediction**: You must first predict whether the incoming wave will break when it hits your seawall.
   - Correct predictions earn you a +5 HP bonus and 100 points
   - Incorrect predictions receive no bonus

3. **Defense Selection**: Choose your defense strategy:
   - **Flatten Slope**: Most effective against breaking waves (reduces damage from 10 to 5 HP)
   - **Steepen Slope**: Most effective against non-breaking waves (reduces damage from 3 to 1 HP)
   - **Emergency Repair**: Immediately adds +10 HP to your seawall (useful when critically damaged)

4. **Educational Fact**: After each round, you'll learn an interesting fact about wave dynamics and seawall engineering.

### Scoring System

- Start with 50 HP (Health Points) for your seawall
- +100 points for each correct wave prediction
- +5 HP bonus for correct predictions
- Final score = Points earned + (remaining HP Ã— 10)

## How to Win

- Complete all five rounds with your seawall intact (HP > 0)
- Higher remaining HP results in a better score
- Aim for excellent performance (HP > 30) for the best outcome

## Strategy Tips

1. **Understanding Wave Breaking**: Waves typically break when they enter shallow water where the wave height exceeds about 0.78 times the water depth.

2. **Defense Selection**: 
   - For breaking waves, flatten the slope to dissipate impact forces
   - For non-breaking waves, steepen the slope to reflect wave energy
   - Use emergency repairs strategically when your HP is critically low

3. **Wave Parameters**: Pay attention to wave height, period, and water depth to inform your predictions:
   - Taller waves in shallow water are more likely to break
   - Longer period waves (higher seconds) break in shallower water than shorter period waves

## Educational Value

Seawall Defender teaches important concepts in coastal engineering:
- Wave breaking mechanics and water depth relationships
- Impact forces of different wave types
- Seawall design principles and damage mitigation
- Strategic decision-making for coastal protection

## Technical Requirements

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No installation required
- No special hardware needed
